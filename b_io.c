// Interface to read a buffer

// Filling the callers request is broken into three parts
// Part 1 is what can be filled from the current buffer, which may or may not be enough
// Part 2 is after using what was left in our buffer there is still 1 or more block
//        size chunks needed to fill the callers request.  This represents the number of
//        bytes in multiples of the MINBLOCKSIZE.
// Part 3 is a value less than MINBLOCKSIZE which is what remains to copy to the callers buffer
//        after fulfilling part 1 and part 2.  This would always be filled from a refill 
//        of our buffer.
